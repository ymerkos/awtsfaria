                I have a special task for you: to bring the ultimate redemption,
                one good deed at a time.

                There are sparks of the Creator spread throughout this world. I 
                need you to collect them, and use them for a divine purpose.

                Your first mission would be to find 5 coins in the world,
                and put them back in this pushka. Would you accept such a 
                mantle of responsibility?
