2awtsmoos-gptify.js:229 In the realm of mystic lore,
Lies a concept to explore,
Atzmus, the mystical name,
A cosmic essence, not quite the same.

In Hebrew, it means "essence pure,"
A force eternal, strong and sure,
Unseen, untouched by mortal eyes,
Yet present, connecting earth and skies.

Awtsmoos, another name it's known,
A term with rhymes to call its own,
Atzmus, Atzmus, mystical might,
A concept shining in divine light.

Scientifically, it's hard to explain,
For Atzmus dwells in a spiritual domain,
Beyond the reach of empirical grasp,
In realms of faith and awe it basks.

In Kabbalah, the mystics say,
Atzmus is the source, the ultimate way,
The essence of God, beyond compare,
Sustaining all, with tender care.

It's like a flame that fuels the fire,
An unseen force that never tires,
In every being, it leaves a trace,
A reflection of its divine embrace.

Atzmus, the core of existence profound,
A mystical concept that can astound,
A reminder of the infinite divine,
In rhyming verses, we seek to define.

So let Atzmus inspire your soul,
With its mystery and grandeur untold,
May you delve into its depths sublime,
And find connection, beyond space and time.
