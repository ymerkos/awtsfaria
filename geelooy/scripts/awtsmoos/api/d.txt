<b>And Aaron</b> lifted his hands to wave the breast of the wave offering, revealed from this side and that side, and brought forth the light of wisdom and the sun, the glory of His strength, from its sheath, to show the leaders, the wise, its beauty, by showing forth the wealth of the honor of the wisdom and the precious glory of the greatness of the understanding. The beholder says "borekai" (lightning) there is light and brilliance, the bestower of good speech, which are the holy words of our holy rabbi, the Baal Shem Tov, of blessed memory, which are in the holy books of his student, the great and exalted rabbi Yaakov Yosef HaKohen, head of the rabbinical court of Polnoi, of blessed memory, and in other books and writings. And behold, although Israel cannot be suspected of violating "cursed be he who moves his neighbor's boundary marker" etc., I still came as a reminder that it is forbidden for any Jewish person to print the book Keter Shem Tov within the period of ten years, and also for the printers not to print during the time of the printing and afterwards until the day when the printing of the learned Rabbi Aaron, son of Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh HaKohen of Apt, has been completed, and I have engraved a statue with an engraved commandment in the Torah, to be forever forbidden in its format, they shall not make its likeness without the permission of Mr. Aaron, stated above, and one who transgresses the words of the sages shall have the serpent wrapped around his heel, and one who looks at the serpent shall live, G-d shall pour his blessing upon him endlessly. Yours, standing on the Torah and the service:
<b>The holy Menahem Mendel, head of the rabbinical court of Liska</b>
<b>The holy Shlomo of Makarliv and currently in the holy community of Lodmir</b>
<b>The holy Avraham Moshe of Przshvarsk</b>
